dotlink link.

Description:
    Link a file in the dotlink directory to a location on the filesystem
    Record new link in dotlinks.json in user's dotlink directory

Usage:
    dotlink link [-s] <target> <link_name>

Options:
    [-s] : Makes link symbolic and is recorded accordingly

Arguments: 
    target : The name of the file in the dotlink directory. This path
             must be relative to [dotlink_dir]/
    link_name : The path of the new link from <target>

Examples:
    dotlink link .vimrc ~/.vimrc
    - This will create a hard link from the file [dotlink_dir]/.vimrc to 
      ~/.vimrc and record the link in [dotlink_dir]/dotlinks.json 

    dotlink link my_zshrc ~/.zshrc
    - This is to show that the name of the file in the dotlink directory does
      not need to follow any naming convention at all, nor does it need to have
      the same basename as the desired link

    dotlink link -s some_crazy_nested_conf ~/conf_mess/conf_mess_conf/conf_conf.conf
    - This one creates a symbolic link
    - Links can be made to arbitrarily nested paths
