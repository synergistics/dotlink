dotlink migrate.

Description:
    Move a file not managed with dotlink to the dotlink 

    Steps: 
        - Move the src file to dest or [dotlink_dir]/[basename_of_src] 
        - Run dotlink link with dest or [dotlink_dir]/[basename_of_src] as target
          and src as link_name. More simply, move src to dotlink directory
          and link back to prior location
Usage:
    dotlink migrate [-s] <src> [<dest>] 

Options:
    [-s] : Supply -s option to dotlink link. Makes link symbolic and is 
	       recorded accordingly

Arguments: 
    src : The path of the file that will be moved to the dotlink directory
    [dest] : The path of the moved file relative to the dotlink directory.
	         Defaults to the basename of src
	
Examples:
    dotlink migrate ~/.vimrc
    - Running this command would move your .vimrc to the dotlink directory 
      under the name .vimrc
    - When re-linked, the link from [dotlink_dir]/.vimrc to ~/.vimrc is hard

    dotlink migrate -s ../happy.conf sad.conf
    - This command will move ../happy.conf to [dotlink_dir]/sad.conf
    - After moving, a link will be made back to ../happy.conf from 
      [dotlink_dir]/sad.conf
    - The link will be symbolic
